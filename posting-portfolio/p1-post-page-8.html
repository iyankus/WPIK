                    In today's rapidly evolving business landscape, corporate entities face various challenges that can
                    lead to financial
                    distress. Economic uncertainties, disruptive technologies, and changing consumer preferences can
                    pose significant risks
                    to the stability and growth of businesses. To thrive in such an environment, it is crucial for
                    organizations to adopt
                    future-proofing strategies that build resilience and safeguard against financial distress.

                    <br>
                    Financial distress refers to a situation where a company faces significant difficulties in meeting
                    its financial
                    obligations. It may be caused by factors such as declining revenues, increasing costs, excessive
                    debt burdens, or poor
                    cash flow management. Financial distress can have severe consequences, including bankruptcy, loss of
                    market reputation,
                    and disruption to operations. To prevent or mitigate such risks, organizations need to proactively
                    adopt measures to
                    future-proof their business and financial operations.
