                                with stakeholders is crucial. Corporate
                                businesses should proactively engage with investors, lenders, suppliers, and employees
                                to provide updates on the
                                recovery progress. Clear communication helps build trust, manage expectations, and
                                garner support from key stakeholders.</p>

                                essential to ensure its effectiveness. Key
                                performance indicators (KPIs) should be established to track financial metrics,
                                operational efficiency, and other
                                relevant factors. By continuously assessing the progress, businesses can identify
                                deviations from the plan and make
                                necessary adjustments promptly.</p>
